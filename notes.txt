Icon-only links need accessible labels: li
Nav text uses <br> for wrapping: lines 19, 21–22; replace with CSS block layout instead of <br>.
Invalid attribute focus on the list: line 118; use tabindex="0" if needed.
Absolute asset paths that break when not served from root: stylesheet link line 6 (/assets/styles.css) and fetch URL line 266 (/assets/htmlCode/...); make them relative (./assets/...).
Consider deferring Prism script to avoid blocking render: line 12 (add defer).
Add meta description for SEO: after line 5.

Change h1 titles to h2
change navbar fonts




<h2>About This Site</h2>
<p>
	This portfolio page was hand-built with semantic HTML, custom CSS, and some JavaScript to add interacrivity. 
	The layout uses CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a fixed left nav and fixed bottom footer with a scrollable 
	main section on desktop. It also presents a responsive design for smaller screens with a single-column flex 
	container with the nav and footer fixed to the top and bottom of the screen respectively. 
</p>

<h4>AI Usage Transparency</h4>
<p>
	I only relied on AI as a coding assistant, mainly for quick refactors, accessibility checks, concept revision,
	and debugging nudges. Typical prompts were things like “simplify this layout for small screens,” “why 
	is this iframe 404ing on GitHub Pages” and “suggest clearer copy for this section.” All implementation 
	decisions, styling, and content were authored and reviewed by me.
</p>
<p>
	The build is intentionally lightweight — no bundler or framework—so it serves fast on GitHub Pages. 
	Assets are organized under <code>/assets</code> directory as follows - CSS sheets, icons, fonts, projects, and the p5 game.
