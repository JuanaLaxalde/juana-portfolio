Root: index.html, styles.css, main.js, CNAME, notes.txt

Assets: global assets folder with images, icons, fonts, and downloadable PDFs

A collection of small HTML/CSS exercises/demos under assets/cssCode and htmlCode

A p5.js game under gameProject with audio assets and sketch.js

A dedicated assets/styles.css referenced in your open tab alongside the root styles.css

Portfolio visuals (images/studyProgress.png) and SVG icons

If you want me to go deeper, specify which area to focus on first (e.g., root portfolio 
site, the p5 game, or any subproject). I can then read and analyze the relevant files 
in detail and propose improvements or implement changes directly.
